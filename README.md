# 👋 About Me:
Hi, I'm **Dev Doshi** — a Computer Science graduate with a deep passion for solving real-world problems through **product strategy, UX collaboration, and AI-driven innovation**. 

With hands-on experience at Ushur building AI Agent features, launching user-centric solutions, and partnering across engineering, design, and sales, I thrive at the intersection of **technology, user empathy, and business impact**.

I’m seeking opportunities where I can continue to define product vision, drive cross-functional execution, and build solutions that matter. Let’s connect!
